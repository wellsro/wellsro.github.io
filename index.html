                    <strong>Attributes:</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Started life as a professional musician - Understand how to seek out feedback and suggestions, apply that toward a continuous cycle of improvement.

                    <strong>Addicted to learning</strong> - By collecting skills by seeking to expand knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Tenacious problem solver - It's not about finding a single path to victory, but making sure all paths lead to victory. I'm happiest facing new challenges in a changing environment.
                    <br><br>
                    <Bi1>Nomad at heart</Bi1>- will travel at a moment's notice.

                    <br><br>
                    <u>Perpetually cheerful</u> - To quote a student evaluation, "It's strange to encounter someone in that good of a mood at 8 a.m. every day."
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Meal prepper</u> - Like Calvin and Hobbes, my days are just packed. I've found they go much easier if my food is also organized and packed. This helps me stay agile and focused on what's important.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Pet Approved</u> - I'm kind to animals and they shower me with a corresponding quantity of fur.

                    We often forget a few things!<br><br>
                    How powerful our web presence is and how much of an effect it has on the users of the web presence which will then ripple out into the entire organizational function:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our business success</li>
                        <li>Our market share</li>
                    </ul>
                    Everything can be affected by our web presence and we often get so focused on ourselves and our product we forget the most important thing which is our users. 
                    And effect web design has to be all about your users, it can't be about you. It is about them the users!<br><br>

                    <strong>Web development is not for everyone!</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Almost all companies have some sort of web presence, website, social media, and online sales. As a web developer, you will be making decisions on what content is there what it looks like what channels you use, what marketing and branding you use, and what strategy your user experience design can all come down to you. 
                    <br><br>
                    How can you be a leader in your organization and in their web presence, how can you make smart decisions about web presence for your business?
                    <Br><br>
                    Focusing on <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> are not that bad to work with and don't bite that hard. They are pretty well-behaved languages. 
                    On the plus side, you will be building something and that is incredibly fun. 
                    <br><br>
                    Love the feeling of building something that really works and functions and that is pretty cool. 
                    <br><br>
                    Always cheerful and enjoy teaching.
